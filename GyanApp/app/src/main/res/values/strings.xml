    <string name="nestedSV">Our Behavior shall do the following:
        When a Snackbar appears, it shall light up a custom ToggleButton
        we created. This is a very simple example that will form the
        groundwork for more complex Behaviors you can implement later on
        . I shall take you through every step, even the actually very
        simple creation of our custom ToggleButton.

        There are 4 simple steps when it comes to creating Behaviors:
        1. Create a Custom View (Optional).
        2. Create the Behavior.
        3. Override methods in the Behavior Class.
        4. Piece everything together.

        1. Create a Custom View (Optional)
        To start off we need to create a custom view. Now you’re probably thinking
        this is such a long and perhaps difficult step! Well it can be, but
        for this simple example we shall just extend an existing view, a simple
        toggle button for that matter. We shall creatively call our new viewCustomToggleButton
        as it will extend from a ToggleButton. In our new class we shall annotate it with
        @CoordinatorLayout.DefaultBehavior(CustomToggleButtonBehaviour.class) to assign
        a CoordinatorLayout based Behavior to this particular class. In our case, it’s a
        Behavior in a class called CustomToggleButtonBehaviour which we shall create in step 2.
